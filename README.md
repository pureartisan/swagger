# Visualise your Swagger files in the cloud

https://pureartisan.github.io/swagger/

## Get started

It's as simple as passing your swagger file url:

```
https://pureartisan.github.io/swagger/#url=<URL encoded file path>
```

For example, if you want to visualise this file below:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-samples/master/java/inflector-dropwizard/src/main/swagger/swagger.yaml
```
Simply pass:
```
https://pureartisan.github.io/swagger/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fswagger-api%2Fswagger-samples%2Fmaster%2Fjava%2Finflector-dropwizard%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fswagger%2Fswagger.yaml
```
